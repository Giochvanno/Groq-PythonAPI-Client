# Simple Groq Chatbot(API)

A lightweight and robust Python client for interacting with the Groq API. 

This project demonstrates how to build a console-based AI chatbot that maintains conversation context (memory). It is designed as an educational example for developers looking to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 or Mixtral into their applications.

**Key Features:**
- **Context Awareness:** The bot remembers previous messages in the session.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Gracefully handles network timeouts, API errors, and connection issues using `try-except` blocks.
- **Secure Configuration:** Uses a separate configuration file for API keys to follow security best practices.
